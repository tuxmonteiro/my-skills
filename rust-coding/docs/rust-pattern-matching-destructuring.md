Pattern matching enables you to write clear and efficient code for handling complex data structures. Unlike simple switch statements in other languages, Rust’s pattern matching provides deep destructuring, guards, bindings, and compile-time exhaustiveness checking.

The key insight is that pattern matching isn’t just about control flow. It’s a way to encode invariants, state transitions, and data transformations directly in your program’s structure.

## Pattern Matching Basics

This reference shows the core pattern syntax available in Rust’s `match` expressions. Patterns can match literals, destructure tuples and structs, bind variables, use guards for conditions, and handle references. These building blocks combine to create expressive, type-safe control flow.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    // Basic patterns
    match value {
        literal => { /* exact match */ }
        _ => { /* wildcard */ }
    }

    // Destructuring patterns
    match tuple {
        (x, y) => { /* bind variables */ }
        (0, _) => { /* ignore parts */ }
    }

    // Enum patterns
    match option {
        Some(x) => { /* extract value */ }
        None => { /* handle absence */ }
    }

    // Guards and bindings
    match value {
        x if x > 0 => { /* conditional */ }
        x @ 1..=10 => { /* range with binding */ }
        _ => { /* default */ }
    }

    // Reference patterns
    match &value {
        &x => { /* dereference */ }
        ref x => { /* create reference */ }
    }

    // Or patterns and multiple cases
    match ch {
        'a' | 'e' | 'i' | 'o' | 'u' => { /* vowel */ }
        _ => { /* consonant */ }
    }
}
```

## Pattern 1: Advanced Match Patterns

**Problem:** Simple if-else chains for numeric ranges become unwieldy (checking temperature ranges requires 8+ nested conditions). Extracting and testing values simultaneously requires separate steps (check status code, then extract it).

**Solution:** Use range patterns (`1..=10`) for concise numeric matching. Combine `@` bindings with guards to capture values while testing conditions (`x @ 100..=200 if expensive(x)`).

**Why It Matters:** Range patterns reduce 20 lines of if-else to a single clear match expression. The `@` binding eliminates temporary variables—capture and test in one step.

### Example: Range Matching

Range patterns provide a concise way to match against a range of values, which is far more readable than a long chain of `if-else` statements. The `..=` syntax creates an inclusive range, while `..` creates an exclusive range. You can use constants like `i32::MIN` and `i32::MAX` to cover the full numeric range without gaps.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    fn classify_temperature(temp: i32) -> &'static str {
        match temp {
            i32::MIN..=-40 => "extreme cold",
            -39..=-20 => "very cold",
            -19..=0 => "cold",
            1..=15 => "cool",
            16..=25 => "comfortable",
            26..=35 => "warm",
            36..=45 => "hot",
            46..=i32::MAX => "extreme heat",
        }
    }

    // Usage: classify temperatures into human-readable categories
    assert_eq!(classify_temperature(20), "comfortable");
    assert_eq!(classify_temperature(-50), "extreme cold");
}
```

### Example: Guards for Complex Conditions

Match guards (`if ...`) allow you to add arbitrary boolean expressions to a pattern. This is useful when the condition for a match is more complex than a simple value comparison. Guards are checked after the pattern matches, so you can reference variables bound by the pattern in the guard expression.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    struct Response;
    struct Error;

    fn process_request(status: u16, body: &str) -> Result<Response, Error> {
        match (status, body.len()) {
            (200, len) if len > 0 => Ok(Response),
            (200, _) => Err(Error),
            (status @ 400..=499, _) => Err(Error),
            (status @ 500..=599, _) => Err(Error),
            _ => Err(Error),
        }
    }

    let result = process_request(200, "data");
    let error = process_request(404, "not found");
}
```

### Example: `@` Bindings to Capture and Test

The `@` symbol lets you bind a value to a variable while simultaneously testing it against a more complex pattern. This avoids the need to re-bind the variable inside the match arm. The syntax `name @ pattern` binds `name` to the entire matched value while ensuring it matches `pattern`.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    enum Port { WellKnown(u16), Registered(u16), Dynamic(u16) }
    struct ValidationError;

    fn validate_port(port: u16) -> Result<Port, ValidationError> {
        match port {
            p @ 1..=1023 => Ok(Port::WellKnown(p)),
            p @ 1024..=49151 => Ok(Port::Registered(p)),
            p @ 49152..=65535 => Ok(Port::Dynamic(p)),
            0 => Err(ValidationError),
        }
    }

    let port = validate_port(80);
    let dynamic = validate_port(50000);
}
```

### Example: Nested Destructuring

Pattern matching allows you to look inside nested data structures, binding to only the fields you care about and ignoring the rest with `..`. You can destructure multiple levels deep in a single pattern—matching an enum variant and its struct fields simultaneously. Guards can reference any variables bound during destructuring, enabling complex conditional logic.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }
    enum Shape {
        Circle { center: Point, radius: f64 },
        Rectangle { top_left: Point, bottom_right: Point },
    }

    fn contains_origin(shape: &Shape) -> bool {
        match shape {
            Shape::Circle { center: Point { x: 0, y: 0 }, .. } => true,
            Shape::Rectangle {
                top_left: Point { x: x1, y: y1 },
                bottom_right: Point { x: x2, y: y2 },
            } if *x1 <= 0 && *x2 >= 0 && *y1 <= 0 && *y2 >= 0 => true,
            _ => false,
        }
    }

    let circle = Shape::Circle {
        center: Point { x: 0, y: 0 }, radius: 5.0
    };
    assert!(contains_origin(&circle));
}
```

## Pattern 2: Exhaustiveness and Match Ergonomics

**Problem:** In many languages, if you forget to handle a new enum variant in a `switch` statement, the program may compile but crash at runtime. Wildcard branches (`_` or `default`) can silently swallow new variants, leading to logical bugs.

**Solution:** Rust’s `match` expressions are exhaustive, meaning the compiler guarantees that every possible case is handled. If you add a new variant to an enum, your code will not compile until you update all `match` expressions that use it.

**Why It Matters:** Exhaustiveness checking is one of Rust’s most powerful safety features. It makes refactoring and evolving codebases dramatically safer.

**Use Cases:**
- State machines where new states must be handled correctly everywhere.
- Protocol implementations that need to support multiple versions.
- Command parsers that must handle every possible command.
- API error types, ensuring that callers handle all possible failure modes.

### Example: Exhaustive Matching for Safety

If we add a new variant to `RequestState`, the `state_duration` function will no longer compile until the new variant is handled in the `match` expression. This prevents us from forgetting to update critical logic. The compiler error message will list exactly which variants are missing, making refactoring safe and straightforward.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    enum RequestState {
        Pending,
        InProgress { started_at: u64 },
        Completed { result: String },
        Failed { error: String },
    }

    fn state_duration(state: &RequestState, now: u64) -> Option<u64> {
        match state {
            RequestState::Pending => None,
            RequestState::InProgress { started_at } => Some(now - started_at),
            RequestState::Completed { .. } => None,
            RequestState::Failed { .. } => None,
        }
    }

    let state = RequestState::InProgress { started_at: 100 };
    assert_eq!(state_duration(&state, 150), Some(50));
}
```

### Example: Match Ergonomics

Rust’s match ergonomics automatically handle references for you in most cases, reducing visual noise. When you match on a `&Option<String>`, the inner value is automatically a `&String`, not a `String`. This default binding mode propagates through nested patterns, so you rarely need explicit `ref` or `&` in patterns.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    fn process_option(opt: &Option<String>) {
        match opt {
            Some(s) => println!("Got a string: {}", s),
            None => println!("Got nothing."),
        }
    }

    let opt = Some("hello".to_string());
    process_option(&opt);
}
```

### Example: The `#[non_exhaustive]` Attribute

For public libraries, you may want to add new enum variants without it being a breaking change for your users. The `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute tells the compiler that this enum may have more variants in the future, forcing users to include a wildcard (`_`) arm in their `match` expressions. Within the defining crate, the enum is still treated as exhaustive—the restriction only applies to external users.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    #[non_exhaustive]
    pub enum HttpVersion {
        Http11,
        Http2,
    }

    fn handle_version(version: HttpVersion) {
        match version {
            HttpVersion::Http11 => println!("Using HTTP/1.1"),
            HttpVersion::Http2 => println!("Using HTTP/2"),
            _ => println!("Using an unknown future version"),
        }
    }
}
```

### Exhaustiveness principles

1. Avoid wildcards in application code: Forces you to handle new variants.
2. Use `non_exhaustive` for public library enums: Allows adding variants without breaking changes.
3. Leverage compiler errors: Let the compiler tell you what you forgot to handle.
4. Prefer `match` over `if let` for complex enums: Makes missing cases obvious.
5. Group similar cases carefully: Don’t hide distinct behavior behind wildcards.

## Pattern 3: `if let`, `while let`, and `let-else`

**Problem:** A full `match` expression can be verbose if you only care about one or two cases. Nested `if let` statements for a sequence of validations can lead to a pyramid of doom that is hard to read.

**Solution:**
- Use `if let` to handle a single match case without the boilerplate of a full `match`.
- Use `if let` chains to combine multiple patterns and conditions without nesting.

**Why It Matters:** These constructs make control flow more ergonomic and readable. `if let` chains flatten complex validation logic.

**Use Cases:**
- Authentication flows.
- Configuration parsing with layered fallbacks.
- Processing items from a queue or stream until it is empty.
- Navigating nested `Option` or `Result` types.

### Example: `if let` and `if let` chains

An `if let` chain can replace nested `if let` statements, making validation logic much flatter and easier to read. The `&&` syntax lets you combine multiple pattern matches and boolean conditions in a single expression.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    struct Claims;
    struct Token;
    struct Request { authorization: Option<String> }

    fn parse_token(auth: &str) -> Result<Token, ()> { Ok(Token) }
    fn validate_token(token: &Token) -> Result<Claims, ()> { Ok(Claims) }

    fn handle_request(req: &Request) {
        if let Some(auth) = &req.authorization {
            if let Ok(token) = parse_token(auth) {
                if let Ok(claims) = validate_token(&token) {
                    // process request
                }
            }
        }

        if let Some(auth) = &req.authorization
            && let Ok(token) = parse_token(auth)
            && let Ok(claims) = validate_token(&token)
        {
            // process request
        }
    }
}
```

### Example: `let-else` for Early Returns

`let-else` is perfect for guard clauses at the beginning of a function. It allows you to destructure a value and `return` or `break` if the pattern doesn’t match. The else block must diverge (`return`, `break`, `continue`, or `panic`), ensuring the bound variables are always valid in the code that follows.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    struct Request { authorization: Option<String> }
    struct Claims { user_id: u64 }
    struct Token;
    enum Error { MissingAuth, InvalidToken }

    fn validate_token(_: &Token) -> Result<Claims, ()> { Ok(Claims { user_id: 1 }) }

    fn get_user_id(request: &Request) -> Result<u64, Error> {
        let Some(auth_header) = &request.authorization else {
            return Err(Error::MissingAuth);
        };

        let Ok(claims) = validate_token(&Token) else {
            return Err(Error::InvalidToken);
        };

        Ok(claims.user_id)
    }

    let req = Request { authorization: Some("token".into()) };
    let user_id = get_user_id(&req);
}
```

### Example: `while let` for Iteration

`while let` is the idiomatic way to loop as long as a pattern continues to match. It’s often used to process items from an iterator or a queue. The loop terminates as soon as the pattern fails to match, making it perfect for draining collections or consuming streams.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    use std::collections::VecDeque;

    fn drain_queue(queue: &mut VecDeque<String>) {
        while let Some(task) = queue.pop_front() {
            println!("Processing task: {}", task);
        }
    }

    let mut queue = VecDeque::from(["task1".into(), "task2".into()]);
    drain_queue(&mut queue);
}
```

### If-let and while-let guidelines

1. Use `if let` for single pattern: More concise than `match` with one arm.
2. Avoid deep nesting: Switch to `match` for complex cases.
3. `let-else` for early returns: Cleaner than `if let` with nested code.
4. `while let` for iterators: Natural for consuming data structures.
5. `if let` chains for validation sequences: Replaces nested `if let`.

## Pattern 4: State Machines with Type-State Pattern

**Problem:** In many architectures, business logic is scattered across different services or classes. Adding a new operation can require hunting through the codebase to make updates.

**Solution:** Model the core operations, events, and states of your application as enums with associated data. Use `match` expressions to implement behavior in a centralized and exhaustive way.

**Why It Matters:** This architecture centralizes your business logic and leverages Rust’s exhaustiveness checking for maintainability. When you add a new command, the compiler forces you to handle it in your `execute` function.

**Use Cases:**
- CQRS systems.
- Event sourcing.
- Message-passing systems.
- Explicit, type-safe API response structures.

### Example: Command Pattern with Enums

Instead of an object-oriented command pattern, you can define all possible operations as variants of a single `Command` enum. A central `execute` method then dispatches on the variant. When you add a new command variant, the compiler forces you to handle it everywhere commands are matched.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    enum Command {
        CreateUser { username: String, email: String },
        DeleteUser { user_id: u64 },
    }

    fn execute_command(command: Command) {
        match command {
            Command::CreateUser { username, email } => {
                println!("Creating user {username} ({email})");
            }
            Command::DeleteUser { user_id } => {
                println!("Deleting user {}", user_id);
            }
        }
    }

    execute_command(Command::CreateUser {
        username: "alice".into(),
        email: "a@b.com".into(),
    });
}
```

### Example: Event Sourcing with Enums

In an event-sourcing system, state is rebuilt by applying a series of events. Using an enum for events ensures that every event is a well-defined, typed structure, and that your state aggregates can handle all of them. The exhaustive match in `apply` guarantees that new event types are properly incorporated into state reconstruction.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    enum UserEvent {
        UserRegistered { user_id: u64, username: String },
        EmailVerified { user_id: u64 },
    }

    struct User {
        id: u64,
        username: String,
        is_verified: bool,
    }

    impl User {
        fn from_events(events: &[UserEvent]) -> Self {
            let mut user = User {
                id: 0,
                username: "".into(),
                is_verified: false,
            };

            for event in events {
                user.apply(event);
            }

            user
        }

        fn apply(&mut self, event: &UserEvent) {
            match event {
                UserEvent::UserRegistered { user_id, username } => {
                    self.id = *user_id;
                    self.username = username.clone();
                }
                UserEvent::EmailVerified { .. } => {
                    self.is_verified = true;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    let events = vec![
        UserEvent::UserRegistered {
            user_id: 1,
            username: "alice".into(),
        },
        UserEvent::EmailVerified { user_id: 1 },
    ];

    let user = User::from_events(&events);
}
```

### Destructuring best practices

1. Destructure in parameter position: More concise than extracting in body.
2. Use `..` to ignore irrelevant fields: Makes intent clear.
3. Rename fields for context: Use `@` or `field: name` syntax.
4. Match slices with patterns: Handle different lengths explicitly.
5. Be mindful of moves: Use `ref` or `&mut` when needed to avoid consuming values.

## Summary

Pattern matching in Rust is a powerful tool that goes beyond simple control flow. By leveraging advanced patterns, exhaustiveness checking, state machines, and enum-driven architecture, you can:

- Encode invariants at compile time: Make invalid states unrepresentable.
- Eliminate entire classes of bugs: Exhaustiveness prevents missing cases.
- Express complex logic clearly: Pattern matching documents behavior.
- Build robust state machines: Type-state pattern enforces valid transitions.
- Design better APIs: Enums make interfaces explicit and type-safe.

### Key takeaways

1. Use range patterns and guards for expressive numeric matching.
2. Leverage exhaustiveness checking—avoid wildcards in application code.
3. Apply `if let` chains and `let-else` for ergonomic validation sequences.
4. Encode state machines in types to prevent invalid transitions.
5. Design subsystems around enums to make illegal states unrepresentable.
6. Destructure deeply to extract exactly what you need.
